 Our codebase is organized into clear modules: API, database, NLP processing, and frontend. The API layer interacts with the database and NLP modules via well-defined interfaces, minimizing coupling. Each module is responsible for a single concern, increasing cohesion. This modularity improves the maintainability of the product, as changes in one module (e.g., NLP logic) have minimal impact on others.
