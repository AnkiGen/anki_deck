spaCy provides a variety of linguistic annotations to give you insights into a text’s grammatical structure.This includes the word types, like the parts of speech, and how the words are related to each other.For example, if you’re analyzing text, it makes a huge difference whether a noun is the subject of a sentence, or the object – or whether “google” is used as a verb, or refers to the website or company in a specific context.
